# Advance React Router

1. backend - NodeJS + Typescript
2. frontend - React + Typescript



This project actually contains two projects:

\- A React.js application (i.e., the frontend SPA)

\- A dummy backend API to which the React app can "talk" (to send + fetch data)



You must run "npm install" in both project folders.



Thereafter, you can start the dummy backend API server via "npm dev run" (inside the "backend-api" folder).

The React app dev server is then also started via "npm dev run" (though inside the "react-frontend" folder).



You MUST have both servers (backend + frontend) up and running for the projects to work.



The dummy backend API does not use any external database - instead the dummy data is saved to an "events.json" file inside the project folder.
